# Code Watch
**Code Watch** is an Android app which helps its users keep track of all the Competitive Programming contests held in various online judges.
The user can see a list of Upcoming and Ongoing contests sorted by date and time. They are further sorted by the length of the contests
such as "Short" and "Long" to further ease the tracking as some users might prefer "Short" over "Long". The main feature of the app is to
send notifications to the user 1 hour before any contest starts.

## Motivation
It is often a tedious task for many coders to keep track of the contests held in various platforms. I often found myself missing contests due
to this reason. Some of my friends faced a similar issue too and hence I built this app.
